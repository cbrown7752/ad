## Alpha Delta

Hello everyone, 

 

It has been riley fun to develop the Alpha Delta game. But as of the 1st of the year the game will no longer be able to be played or downloaded. We do thank you for the support on the game. We know more people want to play the game but we only have 1 server. Which means we will start development on a new game. Alpha Delta apocalypse will be the newest game. We will start development in may of 2021. We have no ETA on when the game will be done. But with poplar the last game was we will go ahead and open meta testing apps. To apply email apps@echobot.xyz. 

 

Keep an eye on this site for updates. Once again thank you for your support on the game. 

 

 

Yours Truly, 

Developer 

Culann Brown
